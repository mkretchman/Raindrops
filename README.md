Raindrops
=========

**Raindrops Game**

In this game there will be multiple raindrops that fall from the sky.  Your goal is to catch them with the bucket that is controlled by your mouse.  Act quickly, because once you miss moer than three drops you lose! 


As you catch the rain, your caught count increases. 

As you miss the rain, your missed count increases.

Your score is the amount of raindrops you catch minus the ones you miss.


Press 'S' to Start

Press 'P' to Pause

Pause to see Score

Press 'R' to Reset (Once the game is lost)

If you are skillful enough to catch more than 100 raindrops, you will upgrade your bucket!  (The bucket becomes filled with water and slightly bigger to aid in catching more rain.)

Be sure not to pause the game more than two times or I will think you are trying to cheat and you will be banished!  You have been warned! 


**Glitches**

As I worked on the program, I glitch tested to try to find as many glitches as I could early on.  This prevented there from being a lot of glitches when the program was "finished."  Even so, I found three glitches in my game at the end that all arose from problems with the pause function.  I fixed all of these glitches.  I do not believe that there are any more glitches in the game now.
